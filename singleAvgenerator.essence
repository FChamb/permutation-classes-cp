given n : int
given Av : sequence of int
given k : int  # doesn't have to be given but might be easier to be given explicitly rather than implicitly taken from the length of the permutation Av

find perm : sequence (size n) of int(1..n)
such that
    allDiff([perm(i) | i : int(1..n) ]),
    not (there exists a subsequence p of length k of perm of the form p = perm(i1)...perm(ik) 1 <= i1 < ... < ik = n 
    for which p(i) < p(j) iff Av(i) < Av(j))
