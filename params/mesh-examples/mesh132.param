letting length be 5
letting avoiding be {sequence(1,3,2)}
letting mesh be [
    [0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,1],
    [1,0,0,1],
    [0,0,0,0]
    ]

$ Assume we are trying to find the pattern/mesh in a target permutation T
$ first identify the classical pattern P (avoiding) in T (T[i1]..T[ik])
$ then for each 1 at (x,y) in the mesh matrix we are saying that there is no j (1<=j<=|T|) where 
$ ix < j < ix+1 (so it is between the indexes of the identified pattern in T) and T(i[P^-1[y]])< T(j) < T(i[P^-1[y+1]])
