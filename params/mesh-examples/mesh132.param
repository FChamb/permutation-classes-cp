language Essence 1.3

letting length be 4
letting avoiding be { ( sequence(1,2,3), relation((0,0)) ) } $ should only be 10 contain, 14 avoid (but that is because the permutation is avoided)

$ finally the pattern in the Bruner&Lackner paper was
$ letting avoiding be { ( sequence(1,3,2), relation((1,0),(1,2),(2,3),(3,0),(3,1)) ) } $ 

$  [[0,0,1,0],
$                                           [0,1,0,0],
$                                           [0,0,0,1],
$                                           [0,1,0,1]] ) }


$ $ Assume we are trying to find the pattern/mesh in a target permutation T
$ $ first identify the classical pattern P (avoiding) in T (T[i1]..T[ik])
$ $ then for each 1 at (x,y) in the mesh matrix we are saying that there is no j (1<=j<=|T|) where 
$ $ ix < j < ix+1 (so it is between the indexes of the identified pattern in T) and T(i[P^-1[y]])< T(j) < T(i[P^-1[y+1]])
