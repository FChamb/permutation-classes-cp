% Short description

Constraint programming is a proven technology for solving complex combinatorial decision, optimisation or enumeration problems. 
Constraints are a natural, powerful means of representing and reasoning about complex problems that impact all of our lives.
Constraint programming offers a means by which solutions to such problems can be found automatically, and proceeds in two phases. 
First, the problem is modelled as a set of decision variables, and a set of constraints on those variables that a solution must satisfy. 
A decision variable represents a choice that must be made in order to solve the problem. 
The domain of potential values associated with each decision variable corresponds to the options for that choice.

Enumerating permutations avoiding mesh (or other) patterns lends itself perfectly to constraint programming.
We have created a model which represents the definition of a mesh pattern in \Essence and used \Conjure to enumerate the permutations.

We will share the model, and give insights into how it works, as well as present results to show how competitive constraint programming can be with fast algorithms for NP-complete problems.

% Figure \ref{fig:results} sheds some new light on this challenging issue.

% \subsection*{My first Section}

% Let us recall an important definition:
% \begin{definition}
% For $\Re(s)>-1$, we put
% $$
% \zeta(s)=\sum_{n\geq 0}\frac{1}{n^s}.
% $$
% \end{definition}


% We can state our main contribution:
% \begin{theorem}
% All the non-trivial zeros of $s\mapsto \zeta(s)$ lie on the critical line $\Re(s)=1/2$.
% \end{theorem}

% \subsection*{My second Section}

% \begin{remark}
% Unfortunately, space is lacking for a complete proof. Instead, I can cite a book \cite{MR2445243} or an article \cite{MR1544457}.
